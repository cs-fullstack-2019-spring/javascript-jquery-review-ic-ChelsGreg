### Exercise 2:

* The first button should say ```Show the Secret Message``` and when clicked, the hidden text should be displayed, and the text on the button should change to ```Hide the Secret Message```. Clicking the button again, should make the text hidden again, and the text on the button should change back to ```Hide the Secret Message```
* The second button should say ```Change the Secret Message``` and when clicked will prompt the User to enter a new secret message, and use what is entered to update the text in the ```<h1>``` tag
* The 3rd button should say ```Change Text Color``` and when clicked, changes the color color of the secret text to a random color using the following array (Copy this array into your code and assign it to a variable): ```["blue", "red", "yellow", "brown", "orange", "purple", "black", "green"]```
